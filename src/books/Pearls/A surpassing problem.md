# A surpassing problem

Something to take home:

1. Use D&C to get a $O(n \log n)$ performance, maybe sorted property needs to be kept during the whole process.
2. We need to provide "just enough" information for `merge` the sub-solutions.
3. How to divide? Equational reasoning
    + Distribution law
    + Definition
    + et cetera
